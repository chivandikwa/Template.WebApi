# Template.WebApi

Sample Web Api project that makes use of Nuke Build for the build process. This has support for generation of pipeline code for AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, Bamboo, Bitrise, GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, TeamCity and TravicCI.

This example specifically has CI generation setup for GitHub Actions [See yml](.github/workflows/Build.yml). An identical workflow with Azure Pipelines is also available but disabled [See yml](azure-pipelines.yml)
